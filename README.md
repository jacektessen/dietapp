# Diet App made by Jacek Tessen-WÄ™sierski

<u>For the application to work, you need the MySQL database, which I currently only have locally - I send it on request</u>



mysqlclient (pip install mysqlclient - if doesn't work, use mysqlclient-1.4.6-cp38-cp38-win32.whl from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysqlclient and use command pip install path_to_the_file)
